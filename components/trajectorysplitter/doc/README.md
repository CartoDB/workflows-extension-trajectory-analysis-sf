# Split trajectories

## Description

This component implements MovingPandas method to split the trajectories based on different criteria, like speed (computed based on timestamp and coordinate info), stops (based on stop duration and radius), specified time intervals and observation gaps (defined by gap duration). See [MovingPandas documentation here](https://movingpandas.readthedocs.io/en/main/api/trajectorysplitter.html)
