# Detect Stops

This component implements MovingPandas method to detect all stops in a trajectory. These stops are defined based on a duration and radius, and the component can be configured to return the segments that are considered stops or a set of points with stop information. See [MovingPandas documentation here](https://movingpandas.readthedocs.io/en/main/api/trajectorystopdetector.html)
